- The Extra information in Logs should be thrown out in Formatted Strings like Nginx Logs
- Should be able to handle StackTrace gracefully and show properly.
- Should be able to handle Multiple objects just like in console
- Should have Sync and Buffer Modes Also
- Should have Child Loggers like Bunyan where loggers get chained and scoped
- Should be able to handle "TypeError: Converting circular structure to JSON"
- Should be able to provide plugin support for SLACK, e-Mail . Same log should go to STDOUT/ERR + Plugin.
- Should be able to have give colorful logs in Debug
- Should be able to turn on Verbosity/Debug very easily by single command
